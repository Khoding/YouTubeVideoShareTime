# YouTubeVideoShareTime

Just a simple app because YouTube doesn't have the "Start at" feature on mobile (not Android anyway).
Basically what it does is it allows you to share a video with the app (when installed as a PWA on your phone), and then you're greeted with a wonderful (very basic) UI with a time input field, you can then input whatever time you want to share the video to start at, click on the link at the bottom, and boom.
